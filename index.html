    <h1>🧠 Compression Critique – Step 1</h1>
    <h2>An independent scientific project, open to all</h2>

    <section>
      <p>📄 A first document is already available:<br>
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15334880" target="_blank">
          Compression Critique v0.1 – Zenodo (official DOI)</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It introduces a new way of formulating certain physical foundations,<br>
        seeking to bridge gravity and quantum mechanics through one simple principle:<br>
        <em>make reality more understandable with fewer assumptions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a manifesto or speculation.<br>
        It’s a formal, testable foundation already shared publicly.

      <h3>🔭 What this enables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>YazChain</strong> – a lightweight, logic-regulated blockchain, with no energy waste</li>
        <li><strong>YazLang</strong> – a clear, simple programming language inspired by living systems</li>
        <li><strong>AI Applications</strong> – memory, perception, decision-making (details not disclosed yet)</li>
        <li><strong>Human body modeling</strong> – physiotherapy, muscular tension, movement</li>
        <li><strong>A new approach to research</strong> – open, sober, accessible</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These applications are under development.<br>
         Some will soon be testable, others progressively shared.</p>

      <h3>🔐 What remains protected</h3>
      <p>
        A more advanced version already exists.<br>
        It addresses the limits of v0.1 and provides a more complete framework.<br>
        But it won’t be released publicly yet — by choice, and for good reason.

      <h3>💸 Why I’m asking for support</h3>
      <p>
        I’m working on this project independently.<br>
        No funding. No institution. No safety net.<br>
        The document is public. The tools are coming.<br>
        But to keep going — to move forward without selling out — I need free and voluntary support.
      </p>
      <p><em>If you believe this kind of research should exist, you can help keep it alive.</em></p>

      <p class="note">
        This site will evolve to include more pages and demonstrations soon.<br>
        Everything here is public, testable, and built to last.
